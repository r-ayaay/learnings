### Description
For any user role this can be seen if you view a page with a ticket table like assigned tickets and entire department pages. The user cannot interact with the buttons for viewing each ticket status, found in the navigation bar on the top of the screen. If a user wants to check a ticket with a status other than "new", they have no way to access a page to view that and would have to result with typing the queries in the address bar. The issue was that the div container of the switch used to change the languages was on top of the container holding the buttons, which made them uninteractable because you would be clicking on the language switch container instead of the buttons.

### Changes Made:
- Added the property "pointer-events" with a value of "none" to "localization-cont" class selector with app.css.
- Made it possible for the user to interact the contents behind the language switch container.
- Changes made from NTRNPH23-160 and NTRNPH23-161 are included.

### Purpose:
- Made it possible for the user to interact the contents behind the language switch container.
- Users can now view other ticket statuses by interacting the top navbar.
- Improves user experience.
