# Daily Standup

What I did last workday (09-01-2023):
- Was tasked find another set of inconsistencies in the Admin Ticket application. We discussed amongst ourselves self if it was a bug. And if we agree that it is a bug, one of us would create a Ticket for it in JIRA. and assign it to someone other than ourselves.
- Made several pull request for the bugs I was assigned to fix
- Made my Friday reflection and included it in my pull request.

What I will be doing today (09-04-2023):
- Update the tickets into the proper format.
- Agree upon ourselves on a template for reporting bugs.
- Be learning about setting up servers afterwards.

Blockers:
- none
