It has offically been two weeks since I started working here in this company, it has truly been an insightful experience compared to my previous internship years ago. This week has been packed with new concepts like git branch, checkout, protecting my commits. Because what I have used so far were only git add, git pull, and git push most of the time.

### My application on reporting bugs effectively

  

Calling back to the first day of my internship, I was tasked to read an article about how to report bugs effectively. Today, I finally got to apply what I've read. The main focus of being an effective bug reporter is to place yourself in the shoes of the person who will read your bug report. Will he understand your description? Will he be able to reproduce the same bug that you experienced? These are factors that one has to consider when reporting bugs effectively.

  

Me and my fellow interns were task to locate, identify, and report the bugs we find in a project, as well as make a proposal on how to solve the issue. It was a challenging task, not because it was difficult to find the bugs, but because I took more time making an appropriate description on the bug report. During this process I had this thought, "The time I spent on making the bug report is longer than time I spend actually fixing the bug", The solutions most of the time are just one line changes, maybe adding and removing a few words and letters. But in the bug report, I had to make paragraphs. I reflected on that aspect and come to realize that it may be seen as time-wasting, bug reporting is a necessary step in the process to ensure the we adhere to the conventions and standards of this industry.
